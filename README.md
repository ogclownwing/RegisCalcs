This is a project created during my CSC 121 class at Wake Technical Community College. It was used as our final project to end the semester. It is a simulation which is intended to calculate costs associated with course selections chosen by the user. It is based in Python, created by the user, Traegen Smith, and Roger Sommer. It took the entirety of July 2021 to get it working.
